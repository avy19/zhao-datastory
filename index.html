          For my <i>data collection</i> project, I tracked my use of chatting
          platforms on the computer. Every time I sent a message on one of three
          differentapps — namely
          <a href="https://discordapp.com/" target="_blank">Discord</a>,
          <a href="https://www.skype.com/en/" target="_blank">Skype</a>, and
          <a href="https://groupme.com/en-US/" target="_blank">GroupMe</a> — I
          made a note of it in my Google Sheets.
          <br /><br />
          I not only copy-pasted the content of the message but also recorded the
          following information:
          <br />
          <blockquote>
            ✑&nbsp; what <b>platform</b> I'd sent the message on
            <br /><br />
            ✑&nbsp; which <b>group chat</b> I'd sent the message to
            <br /><br />
            ✑&nbsp; how I <b>engaged</b> with the platform (e.g.
            if I clicked on a link or viewed an image in the chatroom)
            <br /><br />
            ✑&nbsp; whether I was <b>pinged/notified</b>, or if I
            checked the platform on my own
            <br /><br />
            ✑&nbsp; my <b>mood</b> at the time of sending my message
            <br /><br />
            ✑&nbsp; any <b>non-word</b> text I used
            <br /><br />
            ✑&nbsp; any <b>other tasks</b> I should've been doing
            besides or instead of responding to a group chat
          </blockquote>
          <br />
          Although I did not end up using all of the different types of data I
          gathered about my online chatting activity for the following section,
          they were all nevertheless informative about how I chat online. In
          doing this data collection, I learned a little more about myself
          <em>and</em> about the presence of digital data in my life.
          <br /><br />
          Specifically, I became more aware that chatting platforms were my
          primary method of communicating with people on a daily basis; I use it
          very often throughout my day simply because it's the quickest and easiest
          way of contacting several people at once, letting me hold several
          conversations at the sametime. As such, it's both efficient and convenient.

      <h2>Data Visualization</h2>

          <blockquote>
            In the process of turning the data collection into an image for this
            <i>data visualization</i> project, I first learned to try different
            ideas for interpretation, aiming for something that would be unique
            but also relatively easy to understand.
            <br /><br />
            Ultimately, I opted for a simple color scheme and clear layout with
            only a few overlapping parts to promote transparency. The clearly
            named vases for the flowers efficiently represent the fact that my
            data was spread over the course of five days, too. I also ensured
            that the legend included all the information needed to understand
            the differnt parts of the visualization.
            <br /><br />
            I learned a lot about data visualization construction in this project,
            and it had a lot more levels than I initially thought. Even though the
            visualization is competely creative in terms of form — different from
            all typical bar or line graphs — the creator still needs to keep the
            type of data in mind in order to make the illustration easy to interpret.
